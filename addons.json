LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as X/Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a.

Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.\n\nClicking the flag icon loads our default action, <a href=\"https://iplookup.flagfox.net\">Geotool</a>, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr>. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Site safety and malware checks</li>\n<li>Finding similar sites and reviews</li>\n<li>Automatic translation to your language</li>\n<li><abbr title=\"Search Engine Optimization\">SEO</abbr> and web development research</li>\n<li>Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes</li>\n<li>Whois and <abbr title=\"Domain Name Service\">DNS</abbr> information</li>\n<li>Page code validation</li>\n<li>Quick URL shortening</li>\n<li>Copying a server's <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address or other info</li>\n<li>or you can create your own custom actions!</li>\n</ul>\nFlagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by <a href=\"https://maxmind.com\">Maxmind</a>. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.","weeklyDownloads":1315,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Dave G","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/235431/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/128/128264.png?modified=1622132177","width":331,"height":342,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/128/128264.jpg?modified=1622132177","thumbnailWidth":331,"thumbnailHeight":342,"caption":"Flagfox shows a flag icon in the location bar indicating the physical location of the current website's server.

The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\n- Cleaning site data other than cookies within containers will have unintended side effects due to the current Web Extension API where attempting to clear a site data for one domain on a container will also clear that site data of the same domain on all containers.\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":1696,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1622132671","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://liberapay.com/CAD_Developers/?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.542,"reviewCount":669,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1670829069000},{"id":"wappalyzer@crunchlabz.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/10/10229-32.png?modified=1692929746","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/10/10229-64.png?modified=1692929746","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/10/10229-128.png?modified=1692929746"},"name":"Wappalyzer","version":"6.10.85","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4536741/wappalyzer-6.10.85.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.wappalyzer.com","supportURL":"https://www.wappalyzer.com","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/","description":"Identify technologies on websites","fullDescription":"Wappalyzer is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites.

HTTP enables visitors to view a website and send information back and forth to the server. HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, is communication through a secure connection.

Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, facebook, etc.","fullDescription":"uMatrix: A point-and-click matrix-based firewall, with many privacy-enhancing tools.\n\n*For advanced users.*\n\nuMatrix put you in full control of where your browser is allowed to connect, what type of data it is allowed to download, and what it is allowed to execute. Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","weeklyDownloads":369,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?modified=1622132459","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.jpg?modified=1622132459","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.

Regular expressions support capturing parantheses so you could define the pattern: http://foo.com/bar.php\\?id=(\\d+) and define the redirect as http://bar.com/baz.php?id=$1. In that case http://foo.com/bar.php?id=1234 would automatically redirect to http://bar.com/baz.php?id=1234.

Mozilla asked for a few changes in order to reinstate the new version, which I'm working to fix.\n\nImage Max URL helps you find larger or original versions of images for currently ~9800 websites (using ~5600 individual rules).\n\nIt also supports many generic engines, which means it can work for almost any website, even if it's not explicitly supported by the extension.\n\n\n\nIt contains the following features, each of which can be toggled and customized to a significant extent. There are over 300 options.\n\n    Redirect images opened in a new tab to their larger version (if one is found)\n    A highly configurable image popup can be opened by a keybinding (Shift+Alt+i by default), hovering your mouse over an image, or through a right-click menu item\n    It automatically detects image galleries, and will let you browse through them with the pop-up\n    Images on a page can optionally be replaced to their larger versions (e.g. to use with extensions that download all images on a page)\n    You can select galleries and/or individual media on a page to batch download in full resolution\n\n\n\n\nSome of the websites it supports includes (full list):\n\n    Social media websites (incl. Instagram, Patreon, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Tumblr, VK, VSCO, Weibo, YouTube)\n    News websites (incl. BBC, Daily Mirror, Huffington Post, The Guardian, The Independent, Vogue)\n    Generic image hosting engines (incl. Cloudinary, Drupal, Imgix, MediaWiki, Wordpress)\n    Image hosting services (incl. 500px, Imgur, Flickr, DeviantArt, Pixiv, SmugMug)\n\n\n\n\nImage Max URL works by replacing URLs, and in some cases, querying website-specific APIs. For example, if you have this image:\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlOC3mOWsAEi1ld.jpg (1200x800)\n\nBy adding ?name=orig to the end, you will get a much larger image:\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlOC3mOWsAEi1ld.jpg?name=orig (4096x2730)\n\nThis does not replace using a reverse image search to find a larger image, but rather complements using one, as reverse image search engines often don't link to the largest (or original) image.\n\n\n\nPermissions:\n\n    Access your data on all websites: This permission is required in order for the extension to function in any way (redirect images, find images on a page, create the popup, etc.)\n    (Optional) Input data to the clipboard: This permission is required if the \"Enable writing to clipboard\" option is enabled (disabled by default), which allows copying the link to the larger image/video to the clipboard.\n    (Optional) Download files and read+modify the download history: This permission is required if the \"Force save dialog when downloading\" option is enabled.

Some websites use this track to only offer services when the tab is active. By installing this extension a small script is injected into every webpage which overwrites the \"document.visibilityState\", and \"document.hidden\" properties to pretend the tab is always in the active state (document.visibilityState = 'visible' and document.hidden = false).\n\nThis is useful for the webpages that check your visibility state before loading resources like many music webpages. By installing this extension even if the page is opened in the background page, the player will start immediately like the page is loaded on an active tab.\n\nSupported Trackings:\ndocument.mozHidden (only on Firefox browser)\ndocument.webkitHidden (only on Chromium browsers)\n\nSupported Events:\n1. visibilitychange\n2. webkitvisibilitychange (only on Chromium browsers)\n3. mozvisibilitychange (only on Firefox browser)\n4. blur (some websites require the user to keep the tab focused)\n5. mouseleave (some websites use this method to make sure the user pointer is inside the window)\n\nNotes:\nAt the moment there is no exception list, so the extension injects the script on all HTTP and local HTML pages. You need to disable the extension from the options page if you need to bypass the default always active behavior. On Chromium browsers, you can also limit the script injection to a few hostnames by using the right-click context menu item called \"This Can Read and Change Site Data\" over the browser action button.","weeklyDownloads":247,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Brian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15062319/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/226/226673.png?modified=1622135046","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/226/226673.jpg?modified=1622135046","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/addondev/10usd?country.x=USD&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.0526,"reviewCount":26,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/always-visible/reviews/","updateDate":1750227337000},{"id":"{ae865fed-3ca7-4701-bb86-f129e77deef5}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2675/2675390-32.png?modified=6121dbed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2675/2675390-64.png?modified=6121dbed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2675/2675390-128.png?modified=6121dbed"},"name":"LiveTL - Live Translations for Streams","version":"9.0.8","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4553317/livetl-9.0.8.xpi","homepageURL":"https://livetl.app/","supportURL":"https://discord.gg/uJrV3tmthg","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livetl/","description":"Get live translations for YouTube and Twitch streams, crowdsourced from multilingual viewers!","fullDescription":"Have you ever wanted live translations for HoloLive/Vtuber streams?

It enables the creation and dissemination of completely distributed sites and applications that don’t rely on centralized hosting and stay true to the original vision of an open, flat web.

You can instead install it in a normal window first and then later give it permission to work in Private Windows if you want to. Also, Local file:// URLs may not increment due to Bug 1266960 in Firefox.

This type of attack occurs when malicious code is embedded in a web page and the unsuspecting user clicks on it, thereby allowing the hacker access to sensitive information or control over the computer. ClickJacking provides an easy way for site administrators and security professionals to assess whether their sites are at risk from this type of attack. The first step in using ClickJacking involves running an automated scan that looks for common signs of clickjack vulnerability such as hidden frames, transparent overlays, or other suspicious HTML elements that could be used by attackers. If any potential vulnerabilities are discovered during this process then further manual checks can be conducted in order to confirm whether there truly is a risk present on the site being tested. Once all tests have been completed users will receive detailed reports outlining any risks found along with suggested remediation steps which should be taken immediately in order prevent future attacks from occurring successfully against their websites. Overall ClickJackings makes it easier than ever before for webmasters and security professionals alike ensure they’re doing everything possible protect themselves online from malicious actors who may attempt exploit weaknesses within websites through clickjacking techniques . By taking advantage its powerful scanning capabilities users can quickly identify areas where improvements need made so they can take proactive measures defend against these types threats going forward without needing worry about potentially exposing confidential data customers or visitors due unchecked vulnerabilities existing within codebase itself .","weeklyDownloads":14,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Pentester Helper","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17810102/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283253.png?modified=1685598980","width":954,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283253.jpg?modified=1685598980","thumbnailWidth":441,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":1,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clickjacking/reviews/","updateDate":1685515238000},{"id":"{6a2c1f2a-15ba-450a-a7e5-13b634e43ee5}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2620/2620875-32.png?modified=93b04ea3","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2620/2620875-64.png?modified=93b04ea3","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2620/2620875-128.png?modified=93b04ea3"},"name":"YesWeHack VDP Finder","version":"1.1.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4177180/yeswehack_vdp_finder-1.1.2.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/yeswehack/yeswehack_vdp_finder","supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yeswehack-vdp-finder/","description":"This extension tells if visited sites have vulnerability disclosure programs","fullDescription":"Enter YesWeHack VDP Finder, the go-to Chrome and Firefox plugin.

This is the main purpose of the project, filling this gap and being able to see and control what happens. As a side effect we end up also having an interesting tool that helps in JavaScript code developing process by giving us visibility about what is happening.","weeklyDownloads":0,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"gbaptista","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13708635/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198368.png?modified=1622132926","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198368.jpg?modified=1622132926","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198369.png?modified=1622132927","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198369.jpg?modified=1622132927","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198370.png?modified=1622132930","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198370.jpg?modified=1622132930","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198371.png?modified=1622132931","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198371.jpg?modified=1622132931","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198372.png?modified=1622132932","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198372.jpg?modified=1622132932","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/198/198373.png?modified=1622132934","width":800,"height":500,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/198/198373.jpg?modified=1622132934","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1923,"reviewCount":16,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/luminous/reviews/","updateDate":1568479210000},{"id":"@perfmap","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2176/2176107-32.png?modified=bb618e09","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2176/2176107-64.png?modified=bb618e09","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2176/2176107-128.png?modified=bb618e09"},"name":"Performance Map","version":"1.2.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/2909956/performance_map-1.2.0.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/performance-map/","description":"Heatmap of resources loaded in the browser using the Resource Timing API","fullDescription":"# PerformanceMap: front-end performance heatmap\nAdd-on to create a front-end performance heatmap of resources loaded in the browser using the Resource Timing API.\n\n## Usage\nWait for a page to fully load and then click WebExtension icon to overlay a performance heatmap.\n\nThe heatmap colours and the first ms value indicate at what point in the page load the image finished loading.
